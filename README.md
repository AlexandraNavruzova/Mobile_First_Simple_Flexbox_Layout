# Mobile_First_Simple_Flexbox_Layout <a href="https://alexandranavruzova.github.io/Mobile_First_Simple_Flexbox_Layout/">Demo</a>

A simple flexbox layout with 4 divs which follow each other vertically. Each div contains a paragraph and an image. 
In even divs the image is on the left and the text is on the right. In odd divs vice versa. The picture takes up all the height of the div.
(400px).

<strong>Breakpoint</strong><br>
When resolution is less than 600px the divs build up vertically with text following the image (regardless of even parity).
